# Grasshopper 3d printer
The Grasshopper is a fast, cheap, toolchanger FDM 3D Printer.

The main challenge of this project was fitting a toolchanger with 3 toolheads in a $300 (ish) budget

The toolchanger is a modified version of the https://github.com/ankurv2k6/daksh-toolchanger-v2 and they deserve all the credit. The project is amazing and you should go check them out ðŸ’–
